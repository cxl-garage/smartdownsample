# smartdownsample

**Embedding-based diverse downsampling for large image datasets**

`smartdownsample` selects representative subsets from large image collections while preserving visual diversity. It uses image embeddings and agglomerative clustering to group visually similar images, then samples across clusters to maximize variety. Three embedding models are supported: DINOv2 (default, general-purpose), SpeciesNet (wildlife-tuned), and a TiTok distillation encoder (best on bounding-box crops).

Built for image collections that:
1. Contain more images than you need for training, and
2. Have a high level of redundancy (e.g., many near-duplicate or visually similar frames)

In many ML workflows, majority classes can have hundreds of thousands of images. These often need to be reduced for efficiency or class balance, without discarding too much valuable variation. `smartdownsample` offers a practical solution: fast downsampling that keeps diversity, cutting processing time from hours (or days) to minutes.

This approach builds on work by Dante Wasmuht and Peter Bermant at [Conservation X Labs](https://conservationxlabs.com/).

## Installation

```bash
pip install smartdownsample
```

Requires Python >= 3.8. GPU recommended but not required (falls back to CPU).

Note: `pip install smartdownsample` installs CPU-only PyTorch. For GPU support, install the CUDA version of PyTorch first ([pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)).

## Usage

```python
from smartdownsample import sample_diverse

# Default: DINOv2 embeddings
selected = sample_diverse(
    image_paths=my_image_list,
    target_count=50000
)

# SpeciesNet embeddings (wildlife-tuned)
selected = sample_diverse(
    image_paths=my_image_list,
    target_count=50000,
    model_version='speciesnet'
)

# TiTok encoder on bounding-box crops (post-detection)
selected = sample_diverse(
    image_paths=my_cropout_list,
    target_count=50000,
    model_version='titok',
    titok_layer='backbone'   # 'backbone' (2048-dim) or 'full' (4096-dim)
)
```

## How it works

The algorithm has four steps:

1. **Embedding extraction**

   Each image is encoded into a fixed-length embedding vector that captures semantic visual features (subjects, backgrounds, composition, lighting). Embeddings are L2-normalized. The model is loaded once and cached for subsequent calls.

   Three models are available:

   | Model | Dim | Input | Notes |
   |-------|-----|-------|-------|
   | `dinov2` | 384 | 224×224 | ViT-S/14; general-purpose; good default for full-frame images |
   | `speciesnet` | 1,280 | 480×480 | EfficientNetV2-M backbone from Google SpeciesNet; tuned for wildlife camera-trap images |
   | `titok` (backbone) | 2,048 | 256×256 | ResNet101 student encoder; trained on **bounding-box crops** — use after detection, not on full frames |
   | `titok` (full) | 4,096 | 256×256 | Same encoder, deeper projection; higher dimensionality, slower clustering |

   Approximate memory for embeddings (float32, per 100K images):
   - `dinov2`: ~150 MB
   - `speciesnet`: ~500 MB
   - `titok` backbone: ~800 MB
   - `titok` full: ~1.6 GB

2. **Clustering**
   Images are grouped using agglomerative clustering (cosine distance, average linkage) with a fixed distance threshold. The number of clusters reflects the natural visual structure of the data, not the selection budget. This means larger clusters (common visual patterns) get proportionally more images in the selection, while small clusters (rare/unique images) are still guaranteed representation.

3. **Divide-and-conquer scaling** (for large datasets)

   Clustering all images at once requires comparing every pair. For 10,000 images that's 100 million comparisons. Instead, for datasets larger than 2,000 images, `smartdownsample` clusters in stages:

   1. Shuffle the images randomly and split them into groups of ~2,000.
   2. Cluster each group independently (much smaller distance matrices).
   3. From each cluster within each group, pick the 5 most central images as representatives.
   4. Re-cluster all the representatives together. This merges clusters that were separated by the random split, e.g., visually similar images that ended up in different groups now get reunited.
   5. Every image inherits the final cluster ID of its representative.

   The random shuffle ensures each group is a representative mix. The re-clustering stitches it back together. The result is roughly the same as clustering everything at once, but at a fraction of the cost.

   If the representative set is still too large after several rounds (very large datasets, 500K+), the final merging step uses MiniBatchKMeans instead of agglomerative clustering. KMeans scales linearly because it doesn't build a pairwise distance matrix. The earlier rounds still use full agglomerative clustering where the real grouping happens, so the impact on quality is minimal.

4. **Cluster-aware sampling**
   - Budget allocation: every cluster gets at least 1 image, then the remaining budget is distributed proportionally to cluster size using largest-remainder allocation. A cluster with twice as many images gets twice as many selections.
   - Within-cluster selection: uses farthest-point sampling to maximize spread. Starts with the most central image, then iteratively picks the image farthest from all already-selected images. This ensures maximum visual diversity within each cluster's allocation.

5. **Save distribution chart** (optional)
   - Vertical bar chart of kept vs. excluded images per cluster

6. **Save thumbnail grids** (optional)
   - 5x5 grids from each cluster, for quick visual review

## Performance

Approximate times on an NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti (DINOv2).

| Dataset size | Embedding time (GPU) | Clustering | Total |
|-------------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| 1,000 images | ~1s | instant | ~2s |
| 10,000 images | ~15s | ~1s | ~20s |
| 100,000 images | ~2.5 min | ~10s | ~3 min |
| 1,000,000 images | ~25 min | ~2 min | ~30 min |

SpeciesNet and TiTok process larger images (480×480 and 256×256 vs. 224×224) with heavier backbones, so embedding throughput will be lower; clustering time is the same.
